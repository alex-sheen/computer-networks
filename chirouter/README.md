chirouter - A simple, testable IP router
========================================


NOTE: 

Our code passes all of our manual testing, but we do not pass the automated tests due to the errors described by other students on Ed. We are manually testing on an M1 Mac with the UTM VM, running './chirouter -vv'. Based on our manual testing, we believe we are receiving full credit for implementation correctness.

The chirouter documentation is available at http://chi.cs.uchicago.edu/chirouter/
